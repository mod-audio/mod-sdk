	a lv2:Specification ;
	lv2:documentation """
<p>This extension defines a standard for generating web-based interfaces for
plugins. Plugins implementing this standard will be compatible with the MOD device
and MOD host software.</p>

<p>The goal of this interface is to allow user to have an overview of
several connected plugins and quickly access main controls of each one, while
still being able to fully configure each one individually, all this in a web-based
environment. So, each plugin has two interfaces, one for its Icon and another for
the Settings.</p>

<p>The Icon is a representation designed to look like a real device, and will be connected
to other plugin icons by cables to make pedalboards. Ideally, each icon will have:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A pedal-like design;</li>
  <li>A footswitch that will bypass it;</li>
  <li>A light indicating the bypass state;</li>
  <li>Buttons that will control some most important parameters;</li>
  <li>Inputs and outputs in which cables will be connected;</li>
  <li>A clickable area to drag the pedal around.</li>
</ul>

<p>The Settings interface is a panel with all controls of this plugin that can be designed
to occupy the whole screen.</p>

<p>To provide this interface for Icon and Settings, the following resources can be used:</p>
<ul>
  <li>HTML files defining the layout, one for each interface;</li>
  <li>A directory with static media that will be served to browser to build the
    interface;</li>
  <li>Special markup is used inside the HTML to define element's roles and
    functionality;</li>
  <li>A screenshot and thumbnail of the plugin interface.</li>
</ul>

<p>To help the creation of interfaces, several base layouts have been
created. A set of backgrounds, knobs and slider images are available for
the plugin without the need of packing it inside the bundle. Any host that
implements this model should provide those resources. They're available in the
MOD SDK, that provides tools for building plugin interfaces.</p>

<p>A template that will be used to render the HTML icon of this plugin. The
value of this property must be a URI that resolves to a Mustache template.</p>

<p>The syntax and guidelines for templates are the same for iconTemplate and <a href="#settingsTemplate">settingsTemplate</a>,
so this documentation applies to both.</p>

<h3>General guidelines</h3>

<p>To build the interface, follow these guidelines:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Start with a basic HTML template and use the MOD SDK to test it. Feel free to link any resource available in the SDK without packing them in the Bundle. Any host implementing this extension MUST provide those resources.</li>
  <li>Use the {{ns}} tag inside the template to access images and media inside the bundle. More explanation on this at mod:templateData.</li>
  <li>If you need new styles, always prefix them with the name of your bundle (the .lv2 extension is not necessary). In HTML all css classes are global, so this is necessary to avoid messing with the general interface.</li>
  <li>Use the <em>mod-role</em> attribute to mark elements that are functional for the plugin (see below).</li>
</ul>

<h3>Functionality</h3>

<p>Some elements in your layout are just informative for the user, like the effect name, branding and background img. Others are functional, like the knobs and footswitch. A functional element is marked as so by the "mod-role" attribute, and other mod-* attributes may be used as parameters. The following functional elements may be indicated:</p>

<h4>Bypass</h4>
<p>MOD compatible hosts MUST implement a bypass in each plugin loaded. Two elements are responsible for this, the bypass footswitch and bypass light indicator.</p>

<p>The footswitch is an element identified by the mod-role="<em>bypass</em>" attribute. Once clicked, the effect bypass will be turned on or off, and the light indicator will be changed as so.</p>

<p>The light indicator is identified by mod-role="<em>bypass-light</em>". It will automatically receive the class <em>on</em> or <em>off</em>, so designers are expected to implement a background image for each of these classes, or equivalent.</p>

<h4>Control buttons</h4>
<p>Each plugin can have buttons to control plugin's parameters. Each button is identified by the attribute mod-role="<em>input-control-port</em>" and configured by <em>mod-port-symbol</em> attribute, which must hold the port's symbol, and <em>mod-widget</em> attribute, that defines which widget to use. The available widgets are <em>film</em>, <em>select</em> and <em>custom-select</em>, and each of them expects a certain HTML structure in this element.</p>

<h5>Film widget</h5>

<p>The film widget works like a movie film: it uses a big stripe of images and roll it to choose a scene, giving the impression of an animation. So, if you use mod-widget="film", this element is expected to have a background-image style, with one big horizontal <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/css/css_image_sprites.asp">sprite</a> as background. User will be able to change that parameter by clicking on the control button and dragging the mouse up or down. As this is done, the background image will be moved to reflect the new state.</p>

<p>The minimum value of that port will be represented by the first position of the sprite and the maximum value by the last one. The number of steps will be calculated by dividing the background width by the element's width, considering the background-size style. The actual number of steps will be the minimum between the number of images in sprite and the steps limited by lv2 definition (by <a href="http://lv2plug.in/ns/ext/port-props/#rangeSteps">rangeSteps</a>, <a href="http://lv2plug.in/ns/lv2core/#enumeration">enumeration</a> or <a href="http://lv2plug.in/ns/lv2core/#toggled">toggled</a>.</p>

<p>For example, suppose you want to build a horizontal slider that can hold 10 different positions occupies an area of 150x30 pixels, to control the drive parameter of your plugin. For that, you could:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Design an image of 1500x30 pixels, each piece of 150x30 representing one position of the slider;</li>
  <li>Save it inside the mod:resourcesDirectory directory, in your bundle, as slider.png</li>
  <li>Put the following code into your HTML: &lt;div mod-role="input-control-port" mod-port-symbol="drive" style="width: 150px; height: 30px; background-image: url(/resources/slider.png{{ns}}"&gt;</li>
  <li>Suppose you wanted to use the same sprite for a half sized version of the slider, you could instead use the style "width: 75px; height: 15px; background-image: url(/resources/slider.png{{ns}}; background-size: auto 15px;"</li>
</ul>

<h5>Select widget</h5>

<p>The select widget is a simple &lt;select&gt; html element will available options, each one representing one value for this control port. It's mainly intended to be used for ports with the lv2:enumeration property, but can be used for any case in which picking values from a limited set is desired.</p>

<p>So, if you use mod-widget="select", this element is expected to be a &lt;select&gt; and contain several options, each of them must have the <em>value</em> attribute reflecting the float value of this property.</p>

<h5>Custom select widget</h5>

<p>This widget is similar in functionality to select widget, but instead of a select html element holding options, you can choose any element types to represent the widget and the options. If you use mod-role="custom-select", this element is expected to have children elements with the attributes mod-role="<em>enumeration-option</em>" and mod-port-value="(float value)". The selected element will receive the <em>selected</em> class, and so you can define your CSS as to highlight it as desired.</p>

<h4>Control values</h4>

<p>To allow user to see the minimum, maximum and current value of a plugin, three mod-roles are available: <em>input-control-minimum</em>, <em>input-control-maximum</em> and <em>input-control-value</em>. All of them expect a mod-port-symbol attribute containing the symbol of the port.</p>

<p>The <em>input-control-minimum</em>, <em>input-control-maximum</em> will have have it's text content set to be the formatted minimum and maximum values accepted by this control, as defined by the <a href="http://lv2plug.in/ns/lv2core#minimum">lv2:minimum</a> and <a href="http://lv2plug.in/ns/lv2core#maximum">lv2:maximum</a> properties respectively. The <em>input-control-value</em> will be dinamically changed everytime the value of the control port changes.</p>

<p>All values are formatted according to the <a href="http://lv2plug.in/ns/extensions/units#unit">units:unit</a>'s <a href="http://lv2plug.in/ns/extensions/units#render">render</a> property of this port, with some considerations. First, any %f will be rendered as %.2f, otherwise interface is messed up with huge representations. Second, if <a href="http://lv2plug.in/ns/lv2core#integer">integer</a> property is declared, then any %f, %.Xf or so will be substituted by %d.</p>

<h4>Audio ports</h4>

<p>Each plugin has audio input and output ports. They are identified by mod-role="<em>input-control-port</em>" and mod-role="<em>output-control-port</em>" attributes respectively, and both must have a mod-port-symbol property containing the port symbol.</p>

<p>For implementing the connections, each output will receive a &lt;div&gt; element inside, representing a jack (this will be automatically inserted). This jack can be dragged by user and dropped inside an input, and so a connection will be made.</p>

<p>This does not apply to Settings template</p>

<h4>Drag handle</h4>
<p>Plugins can be dragged around the pedalboard dashboard. To define which area of the plugin can be clicked for dragging, an element with the attribute mod-role="<em>drag-handle</em>" can be defined.</p>

<p>This does not apply to Settings template</p>

<p>The data that will be used to render the template defined in mod:template.
The value of this property must be a URI that resolves to a json serialized

<p>This parameter isn't strictly necessary to build a plugin layout, as the
template can hold the final HTML file, but it's very useful to allow developers
to customize layout using templates provided by the SDK, instead of editing
HTML files.</p>

<p>The data in this file must be a dictionary. Two keys are automatically set:
<em>effect, <em>ns</em>.</p>

<h3>effect</h3>
<p>This will always hold the effect's data parsed from ttl files. The effect data format is an arbitrary structure that organizes the rdf triples in a simple way. To see that structure, use the SDK's debugging interface</p>

<h3>ns</h3>
<p>All static files in folder defined by mod:resourcesDirectory will be available to the
interface, in path /resources of the webserver. To know where to look, the webserver
needs a ?bundle=BUNDLE&url=EFFECT_URL parameter.</p>

<p>To make this job easier, the <em>ns</em> variable will hold the correct url parameter,
so if you want to customize your template (say, have your brand image in the pedal),
you can refer to it like this:
&lt;img alt="Brand image example" src="/resources/brand.png{{ns}}"/&gt;</p>

<p><em>Note</em>: using a static url with ?bundle=BUNDLE parameter in any template would be a violation of
<a href="http://lv2plug.in/wiki/Bundle_Definition">LV2 Bundle Definition</a> guidelines. So hosts should
not require the bundle parameter to load the resources. This parameter is used mostly by the SDK, since
speed of reloading for testing interface is an issue there and no bundle index is made. Anyway, this parameter
